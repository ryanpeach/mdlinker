# MkLinker

A linter whose goal is to lint wikilinks in a variety of markdown note taking apps.

# Lint Rules

- [X] Similar Files: Two files share a very similar title. Maybe you should combine them?
- [ ] Broken Wikilink: Some wikilink's derived file path does not exist. Maybe you should create it, or maybe the link title is misspelled?
- [ ] Unlinked Text: Text was detected which is very similar to some file title or alias. Maybe you should wrap it as a link?

# Compatibility

- [X] Logseq
- [X] Obsidian
- [ ] Roam
- [ ] Joplin
